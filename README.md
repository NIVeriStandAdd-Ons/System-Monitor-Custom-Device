## System Monitor Custom Device ##

**System Monitor Custom Device** is a Custom Device that tracks memory resources and CPU usage on an RT Target running the VeriStand Engine.  Set the update rate (Hz) in the System Explorer to determine how often the custom device checks the CPU usage and memory resource values and sends them to the VeriStand Engine.

The NI VeriStand System Monitor can only be used on an RT Target. Running a System Definition File targeted to localhost that contains an System Monitor Custom Device will produce an error.
